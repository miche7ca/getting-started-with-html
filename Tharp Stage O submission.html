  <p><b>Question on Submission</b></p>
I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to submit after <b>Stage O</b>.<br>
Did you want me to type up my notes and create them in HTML with <b>bold</b> font? <br>
Or <em>italics</em>?<br>
Or should I create a link to the <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/nd000">Udacity Nanodegree Portal</a>?
